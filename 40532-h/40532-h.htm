<h2><a name="PORTRAIT_MINIATURES_By" id="PORTRAIT_MINIATURES_By"></a>PORTRAIT MINIATURES. <span class="smcap">By
Dr. G. C. Williamson.</span></h2>

<p><span class="dcap">A</span>RECENT French writer, in referring to the art of portrait
painting, exalted it to the highest rank, proclaiming it the
greatest of all arts. He then proceeded, by a series of curious
antithetical sentences, to set forth his opinion of portrait painting,
stating that it was at once the oldest and the most modern of arts,
the easiest and the most difficult, the simplest and the most abstruse,
the clearest and the most subtle. His statement, it is clear,
contained a definite basis of truth, coupled with a certain interesting
extravagance of expression. It is quite true that to draw
a portrait was the aim of the very earliest of draughtsmen, whether
it was that of his companion or of one of the beasts of chase, and
whether he carved it on a bone, or daubed it on the wall of his
dwelling. The first endeavour, also, of a child, playing with a
pencil, or a brush, is to draw a portrait, and the very simplest outline
does occasionally reveal that an idea of portraiture is latent in
the mind of the young artist. If only simplicity of line is desired,
nothing can be more simple, while at the same time nothing is more
perfect, than the outline or profile drawing of such a great artist as
Holbein, or the work of some of the early French draughtsmen.</p>

<p>At the same time, the subtlety of this draughtsmanship cannot
be denied. For complexity and difficulty, portraiture takes a
supreme place, and yet, on the other hand, as the Frenchman points
out in his antithetical sentences, it is to a certain extent a simple
art, and we all know artists who are able with a piece of chalk to
suggest an even startling likeness which they would be quite unable
to complete into the form of a perfect portrait. Many a painter
thinks at first that portraiture is simple and easy, in fact he finds it
so, but the older he grows, the more does he realise that the human
features are complex in the extreme, and that the variations of
expression make the difficulties in the task of portraying them
enormous. From very early times, however, there has been a
natural desire to have portraits of the persons about us, and to have
these portraits in portable form; hence, after a long succession of
vicissitudes, has come the miniature.</p>

<p>It is perhaps as well, even though the statement has been made
over and over again, to emphasize the fact that the actual word
miniature has nothing whatever to do with the size of the portrait.
We accept it, however, as implying that the portrait is of portable
size, and we shall apply it to such a portrait as can lie in the palm
of one's hand, ignoring the fact that the word was originally derived
from "minium" or red lead, and has come down to us from the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
portraits on illuminated manuscripts, outlined or bordered with lines
of red. In two countries especially, the art of painting miniatures
has flourished, England and France, and in these two countries there
have been schools of miniature painters, and a succession of great exponents
of the art, while in the other countries of Europe there have
only been now and again painters who have devoted especial attention
to this branch of their art, and have taken high position in it. It is
more especially an English art, because, although for exquisite grace,
charming colouring, and dainty conception, the works of the French
miniature painters take a high rank, even they must yield the palm
for representation of character to the greatest English painter of
miniatures, Samuel Cooper. Moreover, in no country but England
has there been such a long series of painters in miniature, extending
from the sixteenth-century down to comparatively recent times.</p>

<p>It has been the fashion to commence a survey of English
miniature painters by reference to Holbein, and it is not altogether
an unsatisfactory manner in which to start (although Holbein was
not an Englishman), because so many of his best works were painted
in this country. It must not, however, be forgotten that portrait
painting was practised by native English artists in the early part, or at
least in the middle, of the fifteenth-century, and although we know
very little indeed about these English painters, yet we have many
works remaining which must be attributed to them.</p>

<p>It may, moreover, be stated generally that the predecessors and
contemporaries of Holbein in miniature work were mostly of
foreign extraction, although working in England; such, for example,
as Lavina Terlinck and Gwillym Stretes. We know, however,
that certain fourteenth-century manuscripts were actually executed
in England, by an English artist, and as an example of such work,
Mr. Lionel Cust, in his preface to the English Portraiture Exhibition
at the Burlington Fine Arts Club, points out the Salisbury
Lectionarium, with the portrait of Lord Lovell as its frontispiece,
representing him receiving the book from its maker, John Siferwas.
He refers also to the even better known portrait of Chaucer, painted
by Occlive on the manuscript now in the British Museum.</p>

<p>There is also no question that the actual art of portrait miniature,
such as we understand it at the present day, arose from that of
painting portraits on manuscripts, and, as we have already pointed
out in another place, it may further be derived from the similar
portraits attached to treaties and to documents handed over to
ambassadors. The illumination of a portrait of Francis I. on the
ratification of a treaty of peace with England, August 18th, 1527,
is a case in point. It represents the French King in excellent
fashion, delineating character as well as portraiture, and is the work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
of a painter of no mean skill and discernment. Similar portraits of
Henry VIII., and Philip and Mary, dated 1543 and 1556, and
painted in England, are not of such a high character as is the one
of Francis, but still are sufficient to enable us to regard them as
true portraits, representative of the monarchs as they were. Who
first, says Mr. Cust, cut out the portrait in miniature from an
illumination, and inserted it in a jewelled or ivory case or picture-box,
it is impossible to surmise, but such a caprice, once started,
was likely quickly to become popular. Who first gave up the use
of vellum for such portraits, and found that a playing card in use
at that day was a more convenient material on which to paint, we
also do not know; nor who, again, stretched a very fine piece of
vellum or chicken-skin upon the playing-card, and used that as his
basis, but the earliest Elizabethan miniatures painted in England
are done in one of these two methods.</p>

<p>Prominent amongst the names of the Tudor painters stands out
that of Hans Holbein the younger, and in the art of composition
it is doubtful whether any successor has equalled him in consummate
skill. The illustration which we are allowed to give
from Mr. Pierpont Morgan's collection, and which represents
<i>Mrs. Pemberton</i> (<a href="#Plate_I" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate I.</a>), is one of the most astonishing works ever
produced by a miniature painter. The figure is so perfectly
composed, and so marvellously set within the small compass of the
circle, while the modelling is so subtle and delicate, so refined, and
distinguished by such perfection of line and economy of material
that it is always a delight to regard it, and no portrait painter
would be ashamed to say that he had learned many a lesson from
the unerring skill with which this marvellous portrait is produced.
It cannot be said that all Holbein's works are on as high a level
as is this particular picture, but the two portraits in the possession
of the Queen of Holland, one representing a young lady, and the
other an older man; the portrait of the painter in the possession
of the Duke of Buccleuch; the wonderful <i>Anne of Cleves</i> in the
collection of the late Mr. George Salting; and the companion one of
Henry VIII, in Mr. Pierpont Morgan's cabinet, are all distinguished
by the same perfection of draughtsmanship and skill of composition.
In Holbein we have, therefore, a fitting master, from whom to start
the long series of miniature painters, which in England extended
away down to the beginning of the nineteenth century, or even perhaps
a little later, and in his successor, Nicholas Hilliard, we find the
first of the masters who was actually an Englishman born and bred.</p>

<p>From whom Hilliard learned his art it is impossible to tell.
It would be most interesting could we decide if he ever came into
contact with Holbein, and hardly less so were we able to determine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
that any other master first gave him lessons in this fascinating art.
That he began painting as quite a boy constitutes almost our first
fact respecting him, and that is proved by his own portrait at the
age of thirteen, signed with the young painter's initials in the usual
conjoined form, and dated 1550. Of his history we know that
Hilliard was the son of a man who was the High Sheriff of Exeter
in 1560, Richard Hilliard by name, and that his mother was
Laurence, the daughter of John Wall, a goldsmith of London.
The statement that the father became High Sheriff is authorised
by the inscription on the case belonging to Lord De L'Isle which
at one time contained a portrait of the father executed by the son,
and Walpole gives us the information respecting Hilliard's mother,
corroborated by the fact that the painter named his son Laurence
after his own mother. We also know that he married twice, as the
portrait of his first wife Alicia Brandon at the age of twenty-two is
in the Duke of Buccleuch's collection, and the inscription upon it,
evidently added by the painter after his wife's death, tells us that
he married again. Who his second wife was we do not know,
but it seems probable that he survived her, because she is not
mentioned in his will, and in it he constitutes his son Laurence
his sole heir and executor. He was always spoken of with great
respect by his contemporaries, is styled "Gentleman" or "Mr.",
and his illness in 1610 is carefully referred to in the State Papers;
while James I., when he gives him the Royal Warrant of painting,
expressly styles him "our well-beloved Gentleman, Nicholas
Hylliard." It seems probable that by trade he was originally a
goldsmith, and his portraits show us that the craft of the goldsmith
had exercised a great influence over his life. In his delicate
miniature portraits Hilliard never forgot his original craft, and even
went so far upon occasion as to introduce what was distinctly
jeweller's work into the portraits themselves. There is, for
example, an actual diamond, minute certainly, set in one of his
portraits, and the raised work representing jewels in other portraits
is wrought with such skill and delicacy that only a goldsmith could
encompass it. We know that he took Holbein as his model, for
he himself says so, but his work is very different from that of the
great Swabian. It is ornamental and decorative, very delicate, and
elaborate, but flat and shadowless, and altogether lacking in the
marvellous subtle modelling which marks out the work of Holbein.
It resembles, in fact, more nearly the work of the early illuminators.
It seems probable that Hilliard was not only a skilful miniature
painter, but also an actual working goldsmith, and responsible for
many of the extraordinary frames in which his portraits were set.
Miss Helen Farquhar has with great skill elaborated a theory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
which tends to prove this, and which appeared in a recent issue of
the "Numismatic Chronicle." Certain jewels and miniature cases
have been in the past attributed to the artist, and the result of
Miss Farquhar's investigation is to make it more clear that such
attribution has been accurate. Hilliard painted Queen Elizabeth
many times, and amongst our illustrations will be found a portrait
of the Queen (<a href="#Plate_II" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate II.</a>) from the cabinet of a well-known collector,
which sets forth the artist's peculiar technique. We also present
an interesting example from Mr. Pierpont Morgan's collection
which has been called a portrait of <i>Mary Queen of Scots</i> (<a href="#Plate_III" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate III., No. 2.</a>). It is dated 1581, and is certainly one of the few portraits
which seems to stand the test of comparison with the well-known
drawing and miniature of Mary Stuart attributed to Clouet. It is
undoubtedly the work of Hilliard, and of remarkable excellence,
and takes its place amongst the more or less mysterious portraits
bearing the name of the ill-fated Queen.</p>

<p>Hilliard died in 1619, and appears to have been succeeded in
his royal appointments and his professional work by his son
Laurence, whose paintings so closely resemble those of the father
that it is not always easy to distinguish the work of the two men.
Very few of Laurence Hilliard's works are signed; there are
two belonging to Earl Beauchamp, and one in the collection of
Mr. Pierpont Morgan. The main feature of the son's work consists
in the beauty of the calligraphy in the inscriptions around
the portraits. It is clearer than the more formal handwriting of
the father, but florid, full of exquisite curves and flourishes, and very
elaborate, while the colour scheme adopted by the son is distinctly
richer and more varied than that used by the father, and the composition
is not quite so rigid and hard as was that of Nicholas.</p>

<p>The two Hilliards were, however, succeeded by two far greater
men&mdash;the Olivers. One of them, Isaac, the father, was certainly
Nicholas Hilliard's pupil, as the fact is mentioned more than once
in Haydock's preface to his translation of Lomazzo. It seems to
be possible that some of Isaac Oliver's works were copies of those
of his master, and copies so accurately executed that it is not quite
easy to determine respecting them. In the cabinet of Mr. Pierpont
Morgan there is, for example, a miniature of Arabella Stuart which
came from Walpole's collection. It has always borne the name of
Hilliard, and Walpole himself was careful in the attributions he
gave to his portraits, but in the Rijks Museum at Amsterdam there
are two other portraits of the same lady, one of which is stated to
be signed under the frame with the initials of Isaac Oliver, and there
are two more, even more closely resembling it, in the collection at
Sherborne Castle. The Morgan portrait is very characteristic of<span class="pagenum">
<a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
Hilliard, and the two in Amsterdam closely resemble it. Our
suggestion for a solution of the difficulty is that the two Dutch
portraits are early copies by Oliver from his master's work. Oliver
was an extremely expert painter, and a far more clever man than
Hilliard, for the pencil drawings of the painter and his wife, which
belong to the Earl of Derby, reveal him as a draughtsman of consummate
skill. He was probably of Huguenot descent, the son,
it is believed, of a certain Peter Olivier (or Oliver), a native of
Rouen, who was residing in London in 1571, and we may take it
that his birth was in about 1566; his death occurred in 1617, and
he was buried in the church of St. Anne's, Blackfriars.</p>

<p>Amongst our colour plates are two delightful portraits by him
representing <i>Frederick, King of Bohemia, and his Wife</i>, who was known
in England as the "Queen of Hearts," signed miniatures from the
collection of Sir Charles Dilke (<a href="#Plate_IV" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate IV., Nos. 2 and 3)</a>. In the
monotone illustrations there appear two remarkable works by this
painter from the collection of Mr. Pierpont Morgan. One represents
<i>Philip II., King of Spain</i> (<a href="#Plate_III" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate III., No. 1)</a>, a fine portrait, set
in an elaborate locket of rock-crystal and enamel work, upon the
reverse of which is a representation of the Crucifixion in grisaille.
This portrait has an interesting history, because it was given by
the king to the Duke of Osuna, and acquired from the Osuna
family, quite recently. It bears a motto which may roughly be
translated "He who gives himself, gives not a little thing," words
which are eminently characteristic of the pride of the Spanish
monarch. The other portrait is of hardly less interest. It depicts
<i>Queen Anne of Denmark</i> (<a href="#Plate_III" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate III., No. 3)</a>, who was painted over
and over again by Isaac Oliver, and who can always be readily
distinguished by the jewels which she wore on her elaborate high
collar or ruff. Amongst them invariably appears a representation of
a sea-horse or a dolphin. This may perhaps have some allusion to
her Scandinavian ancestry, but, in any case, it was a favourite jewel
with the queen, and hardly one of her portraits appears without it.
Here, again, the case containing the miniature is of extraordinary
importance, because there is good evidence for attributing it to
George Heriot, who was goldsmith and jeweller to Anne of
Denmark, and was the founder of the great hospital and school
which still bear his name in Edinburgh, while to the present
generation he is perhaps better remembered as a character in Sir
Walter Scott's "Fortunes of Nigel," in which delightful work he
appears as "Jingling Geordie." There are portraits of Oliver himself
in existence, and a delightful one of his son, while amongst the
collection of the Queen of Holland there is one that is said to
represent his wife. The most notable series of the works of this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
painter is perhaps that which is generally known as the Digby
series. Walpole tells the story of the discovery of these miniatures.
He says that they were in a garret in an old house in Wales,
enclosed in ebony and ivory cases, and locked up in a wainscot box,
in which they were as well preserved as though only just painted.
He was greatly excited about them, and was able to secure the
entire collection, first buying from one owner the greater part of
the collection, and then securing by a second purchase the remainder
from the lady who shared them with the other heir. They were
all sold at his sale at Strawberry Hill, and some of the finest of the
portraits passed into the collection of the late Baroness Burdett-Coutts,
others went to Mr. Holford, and many back again to the
Digby family, who would gladly have purchased the whole, but
were unable to afford the prices paid by the Baroness Burdett-Coutts,
then Miss Angela Coutts. One little portrait was bought
by Mr. Wentworth Dilke, and now belongs to Sir Charles Dilke, it
represents one of the sons of Sir Kenelm Digby, and is a charmingly
graceful little work, by the kind permission of its owner illustrated
in these pages (<a href="#Plate_IV" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate IV., No. 1)</a>.</p>

<p>The work of Peter Oliver cannot readily be distinguished from
that of the father, save for the signature, and is as worthy of praise
in every respect, even if it is not more so. That of the father is
a little sterner and more forcible than the work of the son, but
Peter Oliver is not only known by his delightful miniatures, but
also by the copies in miniature size and style which he prepared
for Charles I., and which represented some of the great pictures
in the King's collection. Several of these copies still remain at
Windsor Castle, others are scattered in various collections, and in
some instances they are of peculiar importance. For example, there is
one in Mr. Pierpont Morgan's collection, representing the marriage
of St. Catherine, by a Venetian painter, probably Titian or Palma
Vecchio, which is apparently the only record of a vanished painting at
one time in the King's collection, but later on sold into Spain, and
which there perished in a fire at Seville.</p>

<p>A curious story is told by Horace Walpole concerning some
miniatures by Peter Oliver. He says that Vertue handed down the
information that Charles II. being very anxious to re-purchase the
portraits which had been dispersed on the execution of his father,
was told that the widow of Peter Oliver had taken back some
of the miniatures, and had them in her possession. The King went
to Isleworth to see her, disguising himself that he should not be
known, and she showed him several works by her husband. He
was pleased with them and tried to purchase them, but the lady
stated that she was anxious to submit them to the King, and if he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
did not buy them, a price should be named for their disposal. The
King then discovered himself to her, and at once she showed him
many more miniatures which she had not shown to anyone else,
and King Charles desired to acquire them all. She would not,
however, quote a price to him, but promised to look over her
husband's books, and let His Majesty know what prices had been
paid to Peter Oliver by Charles I. The King took away the
miniatures with him, and afterwards sent one of the grooms of the
bedchamber to Mrs. Oliver, offering her a thousand pounds for
them, or an annuity of £300 for her life. She chose the latter, but
after some few years, hearing that a great many of the miniatures
had passed out of the King's possession, and had been given by him
to the various ladies at the Court, Mrs. Oliver, who was given to
express herself in somewhat blunt language, said that if she had
thought the King would have given the miniatures to his mistresses
and illegitimate children he should never have had them. Her
remark, which was couched in very strong language, was carried by
someone to the Court. The poor woman's annuity was at once
stopped, and she never again received it.</p>

<p>Following Isaac and Peter Oliver in chronological survey, and
necessarily omitting reference to some of the less important painters,
we come to the name of a man of considerable eminence in his
profession, John Hoskins. To a certain extent he has been overshadowed
by the extraordinary merit of his nephew and pupil,
Samuel Cooper, but Hoskins was a very great painter himself, and
his work marks the beginning of the broader and more powerful
English miniature portraiture, as distinguished from the minute
work of the men who had been trained under the influence of
illuminators, and whose miniatures were too full of detail to be
entirely satisfactory. There is no doubt that, as Walpole says,
the carnations used in the faces painted by Hoskins are too
bricky in colour, but the whole effect of the portrait is simple
and dignified, and there is, for the first time in English miniature
portraiture, a nobility of treatment and a sober grandeur
of effect, extraordinarily impressive. The portrait of the <i>Duke of
Buckingham</i> (<a href="#Plate_V" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate V.</a>) from a well-known collection, illustrated in
colour, well sets forth the dignity of Hoskins' works. It is an
exceedingly fine miniature, quiet in colouring, and entirely satisfactory
in composition. It is signed and dated, and, with respect to the
signatures on miniatures by Hoskins, a few words must be said. It
is well also to mark that in the works of Hoskins appears for the
first time the division of the background, which is rather a notable
feature in the portraits of Cooper, who evidently derived the idea
from his uncle. The effect of this division on the lighting of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
portrait is excellent, the sitter being placed near to a window, by
which hangs a curtain, and the window commanding a view which
in many cases was adapted by the artist to some event in the history
of the sitter. As regards the signatures Hoskins adopted several
methods of signing his miniatures, combining his two initials in
different forms of monogram, or separating them with or without
the addition of the abbreviation "fc." Until quite recently the
statement made by Vertue that Hoskins had a son, was incapable of
proof; although the fact that the contemporary inscriptions on some
of the miniatures at Ham House speak of "Old Hoskins," implies
that there must have been a younger man of the same name, and it
was thought that the variety of signatures might help clear up the
doubtful question, and that perhaps the father adopted a certain
method of signing his portraits, and the son another form of signature.
Fortunately, however, in the collection of Mr. Pierpont Morgan,
there appears a portrait of the Duke of Berwick, signed with conjoined
initials, and bearing upon it an inscription, stating not only
who it represented, but actually when it was painted. This miniature
proved to contain the missing link of evidence, because there
was no question about its authenticity, its accurate attribution, or
its signature, but as it was painted in 1700, while we know that the
elder Hoskins was buried in 1664, we have in it definite information,
not only of the existence of the son, but of the fact that he was
painting miniatures thirty-six years after his father had died. The
same notable collection contains many works by the elder Hoskins,
but only this one which can be definitely attributed to his son. The
collections at Ham House and Montagu House are very rich in
works by Hoskins, those at the former place being distinguished by
delightful contemporary inscriptions on the backs of almost every
portrait, recording in many instances the price paid to the artist for
it. Of the works at Montagu House, one of the finest represents
Charles II. in his youth, and in the collection at Ham is perhaps
the largest work which Hoskins ever painted.</p>

<p>A particularly good example of the work of this master is the
portrait of <i>Queen Henrietta Maria</i> (<a href="#Plate_VI" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate VI.</a>) from the Pierpont Morgan
collection, and this miniature is the more interesting because apparently
it has never been re-framed, for not only is the metal frame the
contemporary one, but it possesses its original bevelled glass, the oval
divided into a series of curved segments, each of which has its polished
bevelled edge. Waller, in 1625, spoke of the Queen in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p>
       <span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Such a complexion and such radiant eyes,</span><br />
       <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Such lovely motions and such sharp replies,</span><br />
       <span style="margin-left: 1em;">Beyond our reach, and yet within our sight,</span><br />
       <span style="margin-left: 1em;">What envious power has placed this glorious light?"</span>
</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>We need not, perhaps, accept the praises of the poet, but at
least we may admire the quiet sweetness of the Queen's face in this
charming portrait, and recognise the skill and dexterity with which
it is delineated.</p>

<p>Trained and educated by Hoskins was Samuel Cooper, preeminently
the greatest miniature painter that England ever produced,
and in the opinion of many critics the noblest miniature painter
of Europe. We know comparatively little about Cooper's history,
but there are few artists concerning whom it would be more
desirable to have information. Fortunately, Pepys mentions him
several times in his wonderful diary; especially with reference
to the portrait of Mrs. Pepys which her husband commissioned.
He was evidently a great admirer of the work of Cooper, although,
as regards this particular portrait, he does not appear to have
been perfectly satisfied with the likeness. He says he was not
"satisfied in the greatness of the resemblance, nor in the blue
garment, but it was most certainly a most rare piece of work as
to the painting," and he tells us the exact price that Cooper
charged him, and adds that he sent him the money that night that
he might be out of debt. Aubrey calls Cooper "the prince of
limners of his age." Ray the naturalist, in writing to Aubrey,
refers to a miniature portrait presented to the Ashmolean Museum
as "a noble present and a thing of great value." Evelyn calls him
"the rare limner" and describes the visit which he paid to the
King's private room, where he found Cooper at work painting the
royal portrait, and had the honour to hold the candle while it was
being done, as Cooper, he says, "chose the night and candle-light
for better finding out the shadows." To all this chorus of praise
Walpole adds his voice, and tells us that, in his opinion, Cooper's
works were so fine that they were perfect nature, and that if
"a glass could expand Cooper's pictures to the size of Vandyck's,
they would appear to have been painted for that proportion,"
adding that "if the Cooper portrait of Cromwell could be so
enlarged, I do not know but Vandyck would appear less great by
the comparison." Even with this criticism, Walpole is careful
not to be entirely eulogistic, and he points out with unerring
discrimination that, although the heads in Cooper's portraits were
so fine, he yet possessed a lack of skill in draughtsmanship where
other portions of the body were concerned, and, especially as
regards the hands, he had a curious want of grace and accuracy,
His faces, however, are superb, and well deserve all the praise that
can be given to them. They have been called noble and masterly,
and the words are befitting. The two portraits representing
<i>Charles II.</i> and <i>The Earl of Loudoun</i>, which we present from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Pierpont Morgan collection (<a href="#Plate_VII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate VII.</a>), and the two in colour,
depicting <i>Colonel Lilburne</i> and <i>Lady Fauconberg</i>, from the collection
of Mr. Hodgkins (<a href="#Plate_VIII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate VIII.</a>), will well set forth the dignity and
power possessed by this great master. His largest miniature is the
portrait of Charles I. at Goodwood, and there is a somewhat
smaller replica by the master's own hand in the Rijks Museum at
Amsterdam. The Earl of Exeter possesses one of his rare half-length
portraits, depicting Elizabeth, Countess of Devonshire, as a
girl, and in the Victoria and Albert Museum is a large square
portrait of the painter, by himself. With these exceptions, the
majority of Cooper's works are ovals, varying in size, representing
the head and shoulders only, and almost all the great collections
of miniatures possess examples by the painter. As a rule, his
colours have stood extraordinarily well; in some instances, however,
they have faded, but it has generally been owing to damp
or to indifferent treatment on the part of the owners of the
portraits. In Mr. Pierpont Morgan's collection one miniature
representing <i>Lord Loudoun</i> (<a href="#Plate_VII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate VII., No. 2</a>) is in extraordinarily
perfect condition, but for a couple of generations it was lost
sight of behind some oak panelling and has only recently come to
light. Another very fine one, in the same collection, represents
<i>Charles II.</i> (<a href="#Plate_VII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate VII., No. 1</a>). Cooper's method of painting is
very interesting, and as he has left behind several unfinished portraits,
we are enabled to study it with considerable accuracy. It is
clear that he commenced to draw the head and figure in brown,
and, as a recent writer has pointed out, painted in the shadows with
transparent sienna, and the half-tones with a pure grey blue. His
work is executed upon vellum as a rule, but sometimes upon cardboard,
and his flesh tints are nearly always transparent, although occasionally
they are upon a white background, and in some few rare
instances, where he desired special effect, he used opaque colours.
Several of his portraits he has never carried beyond the early stages.
They are only sketches, but such sketches as no one else could
have done, exquisitely rendered, full of palpitating life. This is
especially the case with the portrait of the Duke of Albemarle at
Windsor, and with one in the same collection representing the
Duke of Monmouth; with that of Oliver Cromwell, at Montagu
House, and with an extraordinary little sketch, which we illustrate
in colour, by permission of Sir Charles Dilke (<a href="#Plate_IX" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate IX., No. 1</a>).
This also came from Strawberry Hill, where it was bought by the
grandfather of its present owner, and it offers a bewildering
problem to the student. Walpole declares, in an inscription on the
back of it in his own handwriting, that it represents "Miss
Temple, Maid of Honour to the Duchess of York, second wife of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Charles Lyttelton," and that it was the work of Gervase Spencer,
after an original painted by Cooper, in the possession of Lord
Lyttelton, and Walpole ought to have known what he was talking
about. It is quite possible that he is correct, but the original
portrait from which this sketch is said to have been made is not
now in the possession of the Lyttelton family, and the miniature
itself bears such a striking resemblance to the work of Cooper that
it is difficult to believe that it is a copy by anyone at all. We
know how constantly Cooper's work was copied, one of the finest
examples of such repetition being the well-known work at
Montagu House by Mrs. Ross, a portrait of the Duke of Monmouth,
but there is no example known to us of an eighteenth-century
painter copying the work of Cooper with the exception or
this one, if Walpole's statement is correct. Another curious circumstance
about the inscription is that Walpole has made an error
in the name. It was not Charles but Thomas Lyttelton who
married Christian Temple. She was the daughter of Sir Richard
Temple of Stowe, and the heir of Viscount Cobham; thus it was
through her that the Viscounty and Barony of Cobham came to
the family.</p>

<p>As we have already written very fully in another place, we are
quite unable to accept the series of unfinished miniatures at the
Victoria and Albert Museum as being the work of Cooper. There
is no external evidence whatever in favour of the tradition. They
are painted on a very smooth cardboard, quite a different material
to that used by Cooper, and on the back of one of the portraits is
an inscription in the same handwriting as is the one on the copy
by Mrs. Ross at Montagu House, and apparently signed by the same
person. It is quite possible that in the collection the portrait of
Lord Brooke (which was not contained in the pocket-book when
the original purchase was made) may be a genuine work by Cooper,
very likely acquired by Mrs. Ross, as a guide for her own work,
but all the other portraits are, we are convinced, the work of this
clever copyist, and must not be attributed to the master himself.
In the course of our investigations concerning a missing portrait by
Cooper, representing the Countess of Exeter, we came upon two
interesting letters in the Duke of Rutland's collection at Belvoir
Castle, which proved that this portrait was never finished. On the
9th April, 1672, Mr. Charles Manners wrote to Lord Roos in the
following terms:&mdash;"I haesten on Mr. Cooper all I can to the
finishing of my Lady Exester's picture, and hee will surely doe
it, God willing; but at the present the King and the Duke have
put severall things into his hands which take him off from all
else." Then again, on the 4th May, Mr. Manners wrote again
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
to Lord Roos respecting the same portrait, and he then stated
that although Mr. Cooper had promised "with all imaginable
respect and kindeness to finish it out of hand, and actually
begun it, he just then fell dangerously sicke, and confyned
to his bed, and I very much feare hee cannot possibly outlive
three days." As a matter of fact, Cooper did not live a day
after this letter had been sent, for from Mary Beale's diary we
have the information that he died on the 5th May, the diarist
writing as follows:&mdash;"Sunday, May 5th, 1672, Mr. Samuel
Cooper, the most famous limner of the world for a face, dyed."
The two letters from which these quotations are taken are to be
found in facsimile in the catalogue of Mr. Pierpont Morgan's
collection of miniatures. Other odd facts concerning this great
painter we learn from Pepys and certain contemporary records.
We know that he was an excellent musician, playing well on the
lute, and a clever linguist, speaking French with ease. He resided in
Henrietta Street, Covent Garden, and frequented the Covent Garden
coffee-house; he was a short, stout man of a ruddy countenance, was
married and had one daughter. The Duke of Portland's collection
at Welbeck contains the portrait of his wife Christina, and in
another collection there is a portrait of his daughter, both fine
paintings by the master himself. Christina Cooper was a Miss
Turner, and her other sister, Edith, married the father of Alexander
Pope. Mrs. Cooper was Pope's godmother and taught him his
letters, and to her godson she bequeathed a "painted china dish
with a silver pot and a dish to set it in," as well as the reversion
of her books, pictures and medals, with Samuel Cooper's "grinding
stone and muller," and some of his portrait sketches.</p>

<p>It is not quite certain that Cooper was born in England; we
know the date of his birth, 1609, but we have no certain evidence
that he was an Englishman by birth, although there is every
probability that this was the case. He was, however, for a while
in France, and he was certainly in Holland, and possibly in Sweden
also, where his brother, Alexander Cooper, also spent some time.
It was in Sweden that we were able to discover a good deal of
information respecting Alexander Cooper, and notably a statement
concerning his account for certain royal portraits in his own handwriting.
Samuel Cooper's appearance is known to us by the
portraits in the Victoria and Albert Museum, but an even more
interesting sketch of him is in the Pierpont Morgan collection,
painted in sepia, on a piece of paper which has been twice folded.
An inscription, which we believe to be in his own handwriting, is
at the back of a portrait at Welbeck Abbey, and is to the effect
that the picture in question, and one or two previous ones, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
done for a Mr. Graham, but had not been paid for at the time
the artist was writing.</p>

<p>There is hardly a miniature by this eminent man which is not
worth careful consideration, and in the power of delineating
character and setting before us the actual feelings of his sitters,
Cooper had no rival, while one of the great features of his work is
its amazing variety. Moreover, the manner in which he adapted
his technique, his colour scheme, and his ideas of composition to
the special circumstances of the person whom he had to delineate,
is very remarkable. His portraits of men are perhaps more attractive
than those of women, although he was well able to convey the
fascination of a woman's face; but the strong, rugged men of his
period were portrayed by him with quite extraordinary power, and
he created a method of portraiture entirely his own, and filled
it with individual characteristics. Two splendid examples are
amongst our illustrations in colour (<a href="#Plate_VIII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate VIII.</a>), <i>Lady Fauconberg</i>
and <i>Colonel Lilburne</i>, both from the collection of Mr. Hodgkins.</p>

<p>Of his contemporaries it will suffice to mention one or two, and
perhaps the best of them was David des Granges, whose work is
represented in our illustrations in colour by a portrait of <i>Rachel Fane,
Countess of Bath</i>, from the collection of Mr. Hodgkins (<a href="#Plate_IX" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate IX.,
No. 2</a>). Of this artist and his parentage we know a little, thanks
to the researches of Mr. Lionel Cust in the registers of the
Huguenot Church in London. It seems probable that Des
Granges, although baptised in the Huguenot faith, did not continue
in that communion, because in 1649 he is mentioned in some
papers belonging to the French Dominicans as a Catholic, and he
was a very close friend of the celebrated artist Inigo Jones, who
was also a Catholic. The portrait of the architect by David des
Granges, representing Inigo Jones at the age of 68, is at Welbeck
Abbey, signed with the initials D.D.G., and is one of the best works
by him with which we are acquainted.</p>

<p>For the works of Faithorne or Loggan, Flatman or Lens,
we must refer our readers to more elaborate books on miniature
painting, and hasten forward towards the eighteenth century.
Before we do so, however, it may be of interest that we should
refer to an illustration in colour of a miniature which has not
hitherto been represented in any book on this subject. It is a
portrait which has been bequeathed through various owners as
a likeness of <i>John Milton</i> (<a href="#Plate_X" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate X.</a>), and there is a good deal of
evidence to support this very interesting attribution. It came from
the Woodcock family, who state that it has been handed down
in direct succession from Catherine Woodcock, whom Milton
married as his second wife on the 12th of November 1656. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
was the daughter of a Captain Woodcock, of Hackney, and the
former owners of the miniature stated that their family home was
in Hackney. Mrs. Milton had a baby girl on October 19th, 1657,
and she and her child died in February 1658, when the miniature
was given to her niece, who is stated to have been present at the
confinement, and from her it came to its late owners, who only
parted with it when actually compelled so to do. It therefore
belonged to the Mrs. Milton who is immortalised by the poet in
his twenty-third sonnet, where he speaks of her as</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"My late espousèd saint,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Brought to me like Alcestis from the grave,</span>"
</p>

<p>And adds</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"... once more I trust to have</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Full sight of her in Heaven without restraint.</span>"
</p>

<p>He says she</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Came vested all in white, pure as her mind</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Her face was veiled; yet to my fancied sight</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shined</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So clear, as in no face with more delight.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But, oh! as to embrace me she inclined,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I waked, she fled, and day brought back my night."</span>
</p>

<p>If, as seems most probable, the attribution of this portrait is
correct, it gives us a view of Milton at a period of his life of which
we have no other portrait, for it must have been painted when he
Was about 48, and it bears out Aubrey's remarks about him, in
which he speaks of his reddish hair, of his "exceeding fayre
complexion," of his oval face, and tells us that he was "a spare
man." Apparently it was never engraved, and Deborah Milton
seems to have known nothing about it, but as she was quite a
child when her father's second wife died, and as the portrait passed
away from the Milton family so quickly, it is very natural that
we should have no other record of it than the miniature itself.</p>

<p>We now come to the eighteenth century, and without referring
in detail to the men who preceded the foundation of the Royal
Academy, would just mention one of the prominent miniature
painters of the early days of the century, Christian Richter by
name. He was the son of a Swedish silversmith who came to
England in the time of Queen Anne, and settled down with his
brother, who was a medallist and a die-sinker. His work is luminous
and distinguished, marked by rather an excessive brilliance of red in
the carnations, but by a very handsome colour scheme as a rule;
the example we give in our colour plates, the portrait of <i>Prince</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
<i>George of Denmark</i>, the consort of Queen Anne (<a href="#Plate_XI" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XI.</a>) from the
Hodgkins collection, setting forth his characteristics in a satisfactory
fashion.</p>

<p>The catalogues of the Royal Academy are full of the names of
miniature painters. The period of its foundation was prolific in
the number of limners it produced. Miniature painting was the
fashion. There were half-a-dozen important painters, and two or
three hundred lesser men. The greater men stand out distinctly.
Of the lesser men, many are only names to us. Here and there
we have scraps of information respecting their history, details
concerning the place where they resided, a few dates, and now and
again an inscription on the back of a miniature to guide us; but of
the vast majority of those who exhibited at the early exhibitions we
know little, and of many of them it is not necessary that we should
know very much, as their work was neither especially remarkable,
nor especially praiseworthy. In considering this period, however,
one comment must be made. As a rule, each painter was individual
and characteristic. He allowed the personal equation to take an
important part in his work, and when the expert is once familiar
with the characteristics of the painter, his miniatures can be found
quite readily whether signed or not. It is this special personal
quality which distinguishes the painters of the period from the host
of miniature painters of the present day who have striven to revivify
the art, but who in many cases have become mere copyists, and
have not allowed personal characteristics to distinguish their work.
With the names of the great painters many are familiar, Cosway,
Plimer, Smart, Ozias Humphry, Engleheart, Edridge, and Grimaldi
are all well known, and the collector is more or less familiar with
the names of a few of the minor painters whose works are worth
collecting, as, for example, Nathaniel and Horace Hone, Vaslet, and
others. There is neither opportunity nor need, in an essay of this
sort, to refer to them in detail, because we are not concerned here
with anything more than a broad survey of the miniature art, and
must not confine our attention to England only. The painters
of the eighteenth-century offer a sharp contrast to those of the
seventeenth, and comparison only makes the contrast the more
evident. In the work of Cooper we have strength, power, dignity;
in that of Cosway and of the artists of his period is refinement,
dexterity, fascination, a spice of flippancy and at times a certain
meretricious quality, but this latter is far less seen in Cosway himself
than in the work of his followers and admirers. The public
demanded something quite different from the artists of the eighteenth
century from that which they asked of the earlier school; the work
had to be done more quickly, and it must be more charming, sensitive,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and radiant. In his skill for giving his sitters exactly what they
wanted, and in setting forth on the ivory the dainty grace of the
women of the eighteenth century, there was no one who could
approach within measurable distance of Cosway himself; and there
is a marvellous fascination about his exquisite work, an individuality
which belongs exactly to the period and represents it in all its grace,
lightness and flippancy.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the nearest in merit to Cosway was Andrew Plimer,
and some of his works are fascinating in their beauty, but in charm
they are never equal to those of Cosway, and the peculiar mannerisms
of the artist prevent them from being altogether satisfactory.
Plimer had very little power of composition, and he invariably
over-accentuated the eyes of his sitters, and constantly repeated a
favourite pose either of head or figure, while the extraordinary wiry
manner in which he delineated the hair marks out his work at
once. Quite as noticeable is his affection for the appearance of his
own daughters, and the very shape of their necks and brilliance of
their eyes can be seen repeated over and over again in his portraits
of other sitters. Less than most of his contemporaries was he able
to break away from a strong personal characteristic; and eventually
it became a species of obsession with him, so that his female
portraits strikingly resemble one another.</p>

<p>John Smart was a painter of a different type, serious, solid,
painstaking. His facial modelling is extraordinary in its accuracy,
and his works, like those of Engleheart, appear to have been preferred
by the more serious persons in society, whereas those of
Cosway and Plimer were particularly appreciated by the gay and
frivolous ladies of the Court circle, whose sun and centre was the
Prince Regent.</p>

<p>There are miniatures by Cosway which are of pre-eminent
beauty, so lightly and with such exquisite skill are they floated
upon the ivory. The quality of the material had, of course, an
intimate connection with the art of the painter. The seventeenth-century
artists knew nothing of the brilliant surface of ivory,
although it is possible that one at least of them had an inkling that
a more luminous material than vellum, cardboard, or chicken-skin,
could be found. There are two miniatures in existence, one of
which is in the possession of the author of these pages, the work of
Cooper, which are not painted on any of the materials usually
adopted by him. This latter is painted on what was at first thought
to be a piece of ivory, but microscopic investigation has revealed
the fact that it is polished mutton-bone, and the painter has so
altered his technique to adapt it to this curious experiment, that for
the first moment one would hardly believe the miniature to be by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Cooper at all. Its pedigree is, however, unassailable, and a closer
investigation reveals many of the master's characteristics, but it is
painted with a very fine brush, quite different to the usual broad,
full sweep of his work, and it stands out as an interesting experiment
on the part of the great painter, who was searching for some
material more suitable for a particular style of work. Ivory was
not employed until the time of William III., and it seems probable
that one of the Lens family was the first to make use of it; but,
once adopted, its use became very general, and in the prolific period
of the eighteenth century, almost universal.</p>

<p>Cosway is said to have experimented in enamel, and certainly
one enamel portrait, with his initials, is in existence. He drew very
skilfully on paper, and a few of his miniatures are on that material.
One of his works, signed and dated, is on silk, but all these were
only experiments, and the greater number of his miniatures are on
ivory, which material lends itself perfectly to his craft. In our
opinion the finest miniature Cosway ever produced was his unfinished
sketch of <i>Madame du Barry</i>, one of the greatest treasures
of Mr. Pierpont Morgan's collection, and by his kind permission
illustrated here in monotone (<a href="#Plate_XII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XII.</a>). It was painted in 1791
on the occasion when Madame du Barry came over to England to
recover her jewels, and on her third visit to this country in that
year. From this portrait a stipple engraving was made by Condé
in 1794, but the miniature itself came into the possession of the
Vernons, having belonged to a Miss Caroline Vernon who was
maid of honour to Queen Charlotte. It was sold in London in
1902, when it passed to its present owner, and in grace, sweetness,
and fascination, is unrivalled, even amongst his wonderful
treasures.</p>

<p>Another delightful portrait from the same collection represents
the oft-painted <i>Henrietta, Lady Duncannon</i>, who was afterwards
Countess of Bessborough (<a href="#Plate_XIV" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XIV., No. 2</a>). She was sister to
Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, and seems to have spent a great
deal of her time in sitting for her portrait, all the artists of the day
having painted her. This miniature is remarkable for the fact that
it still remains in its original frame, a very magnificent one, richly
set with superb diamonds.</p>

<p>Yet another charming portrait by Cosway (<a href="#Plate_XIV" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XIV., No. 1</a>)
came from the Truro collection to Mr. Morgan. It represents
<i>Lady Augusta Murray</i>, the daughter of Lord Dunmore, who became
the wife of the Duke of Sussex, the 6th son of George III. It was
her marriage which, although twice performed, in Rome and at
St. George's, Hanover Square, was declared null and void under the
Royal Marriage Act (12 Geo. III. cap. 11). Her daughter was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
Lady Truro. Lady Augusta was only painted twice, and on both
occasions by Cosway.</p>

<p>Our coloured illustrations include three portraits of women by
Cosway, <i>Viscountess St. Asaph</i> (<a href="#Plate_XIII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XIII.</a>), the <i>Countess of Rochford</i>
(<a href="#Plate_XV" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XV.</a>) and <i>Princess Charlotte</i> (<a href="#Plate_XVI" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XVI.</a>), all of them distinguished
by Cosway's special method of painting the hair, and
marked by that inimitable grace in which he excelled.</p>

<p>We also illustrate from Lord Hothfield's collection one of
Cosway's more serious portraits of men, <i>The Earl of Thanet</i> (<a href="#Plate_XVII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate
XVII.</a>), set upon the usual blue cloudy background, in this instance
a trifle paler than usual, and painted with convincing force in a
very remarkable colour scheme.</p>

<p>Of the work of the more sedate painters, Smart and Engleheart,
we are able to give many characteristic examples. From Lord Hothfield's
collection come a splendid pair&mdash;<i>Mr. and Mrs. Percival</i> (<a href="#Plate_XIX" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate
XIX.</a>), painted with that striking force which marks the best work
of Smart, upon his usual greenish-grey background, and with very
subtle but well-marked modelling in the features. His carnations were
ever a little brick-dusty in tint, and he delighted in the ruddier tones
of the face, but in depicting the shadows he had few rivals. Although
there may be perhaps a certain want of inspiration in his somewhat
quaker-like method of work, and in the very low tone of his colouring,
yet there is an honesty and a straightforward quality about it which
is very attractive, and perhaps that was the reason why Cosway in
the words of praise he gave to a painter so different from himself,
spoke of him as "honest John Smart."</p>

<p>Engleheart's work has a certain resemblance to that of Reynolds,
and the devotion which Engleheart felt towards the President of the
Academy had an evidently strong effect upon his own art. He copied
Sir Joshua's works over and over again, and gradually a good deal of
the influence of the great master permeated the work of his follower.
His miniatures were nobler, broader, and far better set upon the oval
of the ivory than were those of many of his contemporaries, his
draughtsmanship was excellent, and there was a brilliance about his
painting of the eyes which is particularly attractive. The large
portrait of <i>Earl Beauchamp</i> <a href="#Plate_XX" style=
"text-decoration: none;">(Plate XX.</a>), from the collection of Lady
Maria Ponsonby, is a fine specimen of his best work; but those of
<i>Mrs. Sainthill</i> and <i>Mr. Brundish</i>, from the collection of Lord Hothfield
(<a href="#Plate_XXII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXII.</a>), are good examples of his smaller miniatures, possessing
a great deal of charm and delightful in colour. His portrait of <i>Miss
Mary Berry</i>, from Mr. Pierpont Morgan's collection (<a href="#Plate_XXI" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXI.</a>),
is quite one of his finest portraits of women. He painted both these
sisters, and for a long time the two portraits were in one case, facing
one another, but they have now been separated, and lie side by side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
in the cabinet. The two ladies were well known as being the close
friends of Horace Walpole, who treated them with the greatest tenderness
and affection, addressed to them many of his most brilliant letters,
and persuaded them to settle down near him at Strawberry Hill. To
them he dedicated his catalogue of treasures, and bequeathed a considerable
sum of money, and his works and letters were, after his death,
edited by Mary Berry, one of the sisters, who lived down till 1852,
and died at the advanced age of ninety. From the same collection
we have selected two delightful works by Smart, those representing
<i>Sir Charles Oakeley</i> and a lady whose name is unknown (<a href="#Plate_XVIII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XVIII.</a>),
both distinguished by the elaboration of flesh tints, so quietly and so
accurately applied.</p>

<p>The very brilliant, if somewhat flashy, work of Andrew Plimer
is particularly well represented in Mr. Pierpont Morgan's famous
collection, because it includes the notable series representing Rebecca,
Lady Northwick, and her three daughters, all of which are given
in our monotone illustrations (<a href="#Plate_XXIII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plates XXIII.</a> and <a href="#Plate_XXIV" style=
"text-decoration: none;">XXIV.</a>). Plimer
was an adept at flattery, and in this particular case the mother
looks hardly older than her daughters, and the three girls are so much
alike that one has to look exceedingly closely to notice the position
of the band round the head, or of the curl which falls upon the neck,
before one girl can be distinguished from another. The same unfortunate
mannerism belonging to this clever painter can be seen in
<i>The Three Sisters Ellis</i>, brilliant works by Andrew Plimer from the
collection of Lord Hothfield, and here illustrated in colour (<a href="#Plate_XXV" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate
XXV.</a>). When closely regarded it is quite evident that the three
girls are very different from one another, but at the first glance we
almost wonder how their parents could have known them apart.
The painter himself has been led to make little changes in their
costume in order that each girl's identity should be preserved, and
our remark respecting the exaggeration of the eyes is exemplified in
these three very beautiful portraits. By the same painter is the
charming representation of <i>Selina Plimer</i>, the artist's youngest child,
from the collection of the writer of this essay (<a href="#Plate_XXVI" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXVI.</a>). This
miniature came from Plimer's own portfolio, and bears his handwriting
upon it. It is very graceful and light in its treatment. The Rushout
girls form the subject of the largest painting ever executed by Plimer.
His well-known group showing these three girls in one miniature
now belongs to Mr. George J. Gould, and is fully described in the life
of Andrew Plimer.</p>

<p>In Lord Hothfield's collection, however, is an interesting sketch
(<a href="#Plate_XXVII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXVII.</a>), a group of the three sisters, evidently his first idea,
quite different both in composition and in execution to the finished
picture. It came from Plimer's studio, is unmistakably his work,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and particularly interesting as a fresh and original idea, even more
charming in many ways than the finished picture. In the latter,
the girls dress their hair quite differently to what they had it in the
sketch, and very possibly the <i>esquisse</i> was made on their first visit
to the studio, as they stood together that the artist might get an
idea of how they looked. Another example of Plimer's work illustrated
here in colour is from the same collection, and represents
<i>Mrs. Bailey</i> (<a href="#Plate_XXVIII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXVIII.</a>). It is a pleasing picture, though
the curious wiriness of hair to which we have drawn attention is
very noticeable in it. One of the prettiest pictures that Plimer
ever painted of a child is the one which we illustrate in reduced
size from the collection of Lady Maria Ponsonby (<a href="#Plate_XXIX" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXIX.,
No. 1.</a>) It represents <i>Sir Charles Kent as a Boy</i>, playing upon a
drum, and is a bright, piquant little picture.</p>

<p>Nathaniel Plimer's work is rarer than that of his brother, and
we know very little indeed of the history of the artist. He was a
curiously unequal painter. There were times when he could paint
far better than his brother, but there are not perhaps more than
two or three of his miniatures to which this high praise can be
given. His general work is pleasing and agreeable, but does not
betoken extraordinary skill. One of the best of his ordinary
miniatures is in Lord Hothfield's collection (<a href="#Plate_XXIX" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXIX., No. 2</a>),
and represents <i>Mrs. Dawes</i>. It is dated 1798, and is quite a fine
picture, but not equal in high merit to two works by this master
in the late Mr. Salting's collection, the finest examples of Nathaniel's
work we have yet seen.</p>

<p>Ozias Humphry was a greater man than Plimer, but his work
in miniature is rare. His draughtsmanship was exceedingly good,
his colouring quiet and restrained, and his technique so elaborate,
with such fine stipple work, that it has a general resemblance to
that of enamel, but differs from this latter because it is not hard in
its execution; and there is, moreover, an atmospheric quality about
it very attractive. One of Humphry's peculiarities is to be noticed
in the elongated shape he gave to the eyes of his sitters, what has
been well termed "a greyhound eye," affording a marked contrast
to the exceedingly round, over-bold eye, which Plimer was so fond
of accentuating. Humphry drew children exquisitely, and his
portrait of the <i>Duchess of Albany</i> as a child (<a href="#Plate_XXX" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXX., No. 1</a>),
in the possession of Lord Hothfield, is one of the most delightful
miniatures with which we are acquainted. In it his accuracy of
draughtsmanship is seen to perfection, and the modelling on the
face is so dainty and delicate that the miniature is quite a little gem
full of life and vivacity, while the child is represented with a
demure, amused look, which is refreshing and natural. There is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
a very interesting history connected with this miniature. It was
painted in Rome in 1773, when Humphry was there with
Romney, and it eventually belonged to Horace Walpole, and was
in his collection at Strawberry Hill. He is said to have received it
from Sir Horace Mann, his great friend and correspondent, who was
watching Prince Charles Edward (<i>de jure</i> Charles III.), on behalf of
the English Government. The other Humphry, which we illustrate
from the same collection, represents the <i>Countess of Thanet</i>
(<a href="#Plate_XXX" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXX., No. 2</a>), and is an excellent example of the manner
in which Ozias painted a noble lady of a quiet, studious character.
The colour scheme in this, again, is very pleasing.</p>

<p>Time would fail to describe the host of minor men who
exhibited at the Academy, and it would be impossible to illustrate
works by even the chief of them. We have selected just a few;
first, an example of the work of John Smart the younger, who is
especially well known for his fine pencil work, and for some
wonderful copies from drawings by Holbein. There are very few
of his miniatures in existence; and the one of <i>Lieutenant Lygon</i>
(<a href="#Plate_XXXI" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXXI.</a>), in the collection of Lady Maria Ponsonby which
is signed and dated, is a good, natural, life-like portrait, well
drawn and composed. Then we would refer to Nathaniel Hone,
who was an interesting person, and deserves to be remembered
because he was the first artist in the eighteenth century to have
what we now call a "one-man show." There is not a great deal of
credit belonging to him for this adventure, because, had he not
been a very sensitive and passionate man, and painted a picture
which annoyed the Academy, the one-man show would never have
come off.</p>

<p>In a painting called "The Conjuror" Hone was considered to
have made an attack upon the President and upon Angelica
Kauffman. It was rejected by the Academy, and in 1775 Hone opened
his exhibition at 70, St. Martin's Lane, issued a catalogue, to which
he affixed a preface, telling the story of his discomfiture from his
own point of view, and appealing to the people respecting the
merits of his paintings. The result was not particularly satisfactory,
because it was felt that he had been in the wrong. The catalogue
is a very rare one, and the whole story is rather interesting in its
details.</p>

<p>A fine portrait by Horace Hone, the elder son of Nathaniel, representing
William Pitt is in the collection of Lady Maria Ponsonby,
and appears in our coloured illustrations (<a href="#Plate_XXXII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXXII., No. 2</a>).
Horace Hone was a better painter than his father. He excelled
in enamel work, and his finest portraits are in that medium. He
had a fine sense of colour and loved rich effects of velvet brocade,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
satin, or fur. Another of his miniatures is in Lord Hothfield's
collection, and represents <i>Lady Mary Nugent</i>; it is signed and dated,
and the owner has kindly permitted us to illustrate it in these pages
(<a href="#Plate_XXXII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXXII., No. 1</a>).</p>

<p>Yet another miniature from Lord Hothfield's collection illustrates
the work of Vaslet (<a href="#Plate_XXXIII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXXIII.</a>), of whom we know hardly
anything, save that he lived in York and Bath and that he was a
clever worker in pastel. He seems to have visited Oxford in 1779,
1780, and 1789, and there is a good collection of his pastel portraits
on paper in the Warden's Lodge at Merton College, the portraits
carefully signed and dated; on the majority of them the artist calls
himself as L. Vaslet of Bath. There are other collectors in Oxford
who have specimens of his work in pastel, but in miniature his
paintings are very rare. They are distinguished by a cloudy,
flocculent appearance, very much resembling pastel work, and
making it evident that the artist was more at home in the use of
that material than he was in water-colour.</p>

<p>Our very brief survey of English miniature work must end with
Sir George Hayter, by whom we illustrate a portrait of the <i>Countess
of Jersey</i>, from the collection of Lady Maria Ponsonby (<a href="#Plate_XXXIV" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate
XXXIV.</a>). He was portrait painter to Princess Charlotte and Prince
Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, but is better known for his historical
paintings than for portraits, and he is almost the last of the
nineteenth-century miniature painters whose work possesses any special
attraction. After his time and that of his contemporaries Sir William
Ross, J. D. Engleheart, Robertson, Newton, and Thorburn, the art
of miniature painting died away until its revival in recent times.</p>

<p>The painters who worked in enamel occupy a section of miniature
work apart, although in many instances the best known
enamellers painted portraits also on ivory or on vellum, but they are
especially known for their works in enamel. There is little need
for us here to do more than define enamel work as a vitreous
glaze attached by fusion to a metallic ground, but only those who
have attempted to paint portraits in enamel can have any idea of
the enormous difficulty of this method of portraiture when fine
results are desired. Of all the men who were successful in this
most complicated process, Jean Petitot stands out supreme, and his
portraits, as a rule excessively minute in size, are distinguished by
a delicacy of detail, marvellous in its microscopic exactitude. When
it is remembered that the colours were painted on to the panel of
gold in the form of a powder, only slightly mingled with a medium,
that they did not represent by their tint the colour they were to
present when fused, and that the slightest error in the fusing
would ruin the plate and cause the colours to run into one another,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the marvel is but enhanced when the exquisite works produced by this
incomparable artist are examined. The specimen from Mr. Ward
Usher's collection (<a href="#Plate_XXXV" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXXV.</a>), which is illustrated in colour, is
a good example of Petitot's portrait of <i>Louis XIV.</i> He painted the
face of "<i>Le Roi Soleil</i>" so often that he must have become familiar
with every detail of it, and there is hardly any collection of his works
which cannot boast of one of these wonderful little enamels. The
story of the painter himself is of considerable interest, and the
details of his religious difficulties and of his return to Geneva are
well set forth in a book about him written by E. Stroehlin, and
published in Geneva in 1905; while some further special information
more recently discovered can be found in an article by the writer of
this essay in the "Nineteenth Century" for January 1908. He left
behind him a wonderful little pocket-book containing his own and
his wife's portraits, and a narrative of part of his career, written by
him in beautiful handwriting. His own portrait belongs to the
Earl of Dartrey, and there are some wonderful examples of his work
in the Louvre; but the best of his portraits are in England, and
there is no collection to rival that of South Kensington in this
respect. Perhaps his most extraordinary work is the box belonging
to Mr. Alfred de Rothschild, which has fourteen portraits upon
it; but his largest, with one exception, is that of <i>Mary, Duchess
of Richmond and Lenox</i>, which we illustrate from Mr. Pierpont
Morgan's collection (<a href="#Plate_XXXVI" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXXVI., No. 2</a>). It is signed and dated
1643 and is 5-1/2 inches square, the only miniature exceeding it in size
being that at Chatsworth, representing the Countess of Southampton,
and dated 1642. The latter is, however, unfortunately damaged,
whereas the one in Mr. Pierpont Morgan's collection is quite
perfect. With these two exceptions, almost all Petitot's miniatures
are exceedingly tiny in size. The only other enameller whose work
we illustrate was named Prieur, and he married, as her second
husband, Marie, the only sister of Jean Petitot. Prieur was a
wanderer; we find his work in Poland, Denmark, Russia, Spain,
and especially in Denmark, where there are many of his portraits,
and where he is believed to have died in 1677. He visited England
charged with commissions from the King of Denmark, and, while
there, painted a portrait of Charles II. and another of Lady Castlemaine,
both from Cooper's miniatures. He was also responsible for
a portrait of <i>Charles I.</i> (<a href="#Plate_XXXVI" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXXVI., No. 1</a>), but whether contemporary
or not we cannot say, for so little is known of Prieur's
history, that he may have visited England before 1669, when we
know he came over to paint Charles II. In all probability, however,
this delightful work, which now belongs to Mr. Pierpont
Morgan, is a copy by Prieur from the portrait of the King by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
Vandyck. Prieur executed several delightful enamel badges for the
Danish Orders, and appears to have been in high repute at the
courts both of Frederik III. and Christian V.</p>

<p>We have now to deal briefly with the long range of foreign
miniature painters, the chief of whom were resident in France,
although not always natives of that country. There was a regular
tradition of miniature painting in France, extending from the times
of the Clouets down to those of the great painters Isabey and
Augustin. The works by Jean Clouet were, of course, more of the
nature of paintings in manuscripts, and if we are accurate in
attributing one of the great gems of Mr. Morgan's collection to
Jean Clouet himself, it adds one to the only other seven portraits
which have been, with any amount of accuracy, given to this
painter. All of the seven are illustrations in one manuscript
volume, and probably this eighth was either executed for the same
purpose, or has actually been removed from a contemporary work of
that kind. When we come to the later Clouets, François especially,
we have actual miniatures, and in several instances the drawings for
the portraits exist, also enabling us to identify whom the miniatures
represent. It would be impossible within the limits of this short
essay to deal with all those who succeeded the sixteenth-century
men, and we have to make a big jump to the eighteenth century,
because it was during that time that the most notable of the French
miniature painters flourished, and their works are by far the most
important.</p>

<p>Nattier began as a miniature painter, and his mother painted
miniatures, and is said to have taught him his art. Later on, he
became a well-known portrait painter, but speculating in the wild
schemes of John Law, lost his fortune, and a good many of his
friends. Once he took up with miniature painting to re-introduce
himself to the clients he had lost when he neglected art for the
excitement of finance, then dropped it again, and confined his
attention down to the time of his death to portrait painting. We
illustrate a delightful portrait of <i>Madame Dupin</i> (<a href="#Plate_XXXVII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXXVII.,
No. 1</a>), the wife of a writer on finance, whose book was suppressed
by the order of Madame de Pompadour; but we remember the fair
lady who is set forth in this portrait more by reason of the fact that
Rousseau was at one time her secretary, and was very much attached
to her. The portrait shows her in the hey-day of beauty.</p>

<p>By Hall, the Swede, who lived in Paris, and is generally
regarded as a Frenchman, we illustrate a portrait of the <i>Countess
Sophie Potoçki</i> (<a href="#Plate_XXXVII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXXVII., No. 2</a>), the celebrated Greek
beauty, who became a member of one of the noblest families of
the Polish aristocracy. Her story is a strange one. She was born
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of Greek parents at Constantinople, purchased as a slave by the
Russian general De Witte, who made her his mistress; but one
night, losing a considerable sum of money at cards, when playing
against Count Felix Potoçki, he received an offer from his opponent
to waive all claims if the Russian general would pass over his slave
to Count Felix. The offer was accepted, and Sophie Clavona
became the property of the Polish Count, who was already deeply
in love with her. Despite the expostulations of his friends, he
promptly made her his second wife, and they lived happily together
for many years, while her heritage of beauty has been handed down
through succeeding generations. Her portrait was painted over
and over again, and the example of it which we illustrate remained
for a long time in the private gallery of the family at Warsaw,
together with a replica which is still there. It was finally sold to
a French dealer, from whom it passed into the hands of its present
owner. The famous beauty is in a deep red costume, which
wonderfully sets off the charm of her countenance. Another work
by Hall from the same famous collection (<a href="#Plate_XXXVII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXXVII., No. 3</a>)
represents the ill-fated <i>Princesse de Lamballe</i>, "beauty, goodness and
virtue personified, but all her goodness and gentleness could not
soften the hearts of those inhuman tigers who immolated her on
the altar of Equality." Few scenes are more pitiable than that
of the execution of this beautiful woman. She had never committed
any action which could have incurred the hatred of the
people, but she was the friend of the Queen, and the possessor of
considerable wealth; reasons enough to bring upon her head the
wrath of the tyrants who preached freedom to France. This
miniature is particularly charming in its domestic quality. Madame
de Lamballe is shown in her room, engaged in making a wreath of
flowers, and every detail concerning her occupation, and the room
in which she is seated, is delightfully rendered; but the whole
composition is kept so well in hand that the details do not obtrude,
nor in any way draw aside the attention from the fair countenance
of the lady herself.</p>

<p>The work of Pierre Pasquier is very rare, and not a single
example of it is to be seen in the Louvre. He was born in 1731,
and died in 1806. He worked largely in enamel, and a great many
of his portraits appear on the wonderful snuff-boxes which were
given to ministers or eminent diplomatists. Several of them are in
Russia. He was distinguished by an unerring perfection of draughtsmanship,
and this is especially set forth in his profile portraits, one
of which, signed and dated, we illustrate from Mr. Morgan's collection
(<a href="#Plate_XXXVIII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXXVIII., No. 2</a>). It is probably the finest example of
Pasquier's work in existence, and is little more than a sketch in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
black on ivory, with a steel-blue background, the ivory being left
clear where the portrait appears. We do not know who it represents,
but it was probably a study for an enamel left incomplete.
It is dated 1786, and in its rigid economy of line, exquisite low-toned
scheme of colour, and perfection of drawing, occupies an
exceedingly high place in miniature painting, and leaves us only
regretful that we are ignorant of the name of the sitter.</p>

<p>The example we illustrate of the miniature work of Fragonard
must also be anonymous (<a href="#Plate_XXXVIII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXXVIII., No. 1 </a>). It is a boy's
portrait, and has been said, with a certain amount of evidence, to
represent one of his own sons, it certainly does resemble a sketch of
one of Fragonard's children, which the artist has named, but not
sufficiently for us to be sure respecting the accuracy of the attribution.
No one, however, but Fragonard could have painted it, the
colour is so daintily placed upon the ivory as to give the effect of
having been wafted upon the material, and resting upon it with a
feathery lightness. There is generally a good deal of yellow in
Fragonard's portraits, or else the colour scheme is mainly grey and
white, and this portrait belongs to the second division we have
mentioned. It is very pleasing, the face of a quiet, thoughtful
child, charmingly represented, and a good example of the work of
one of the greatest decorators France ever knew. Fragonard's
miniatures are rare, we may add, very rare, and probably no one
has such a collection of them as is to be found in the cabinets of
Mr. Pierpont Morgan.</p>

<p>By Garriot, a painter who was born in 1811 at Toulouse,
studied at Madrid, and painted in Geneva, we illustrate from
Mr. Pierpont Morgan's collection a portrait of the <i>Marquise de
Villette</i> (<a href="#Plate_XXXIX" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXXIX., No. 2</a>), better known as "Belle et Bonne,"
who was practically adopted as a daughter by Voltaire, and married
to the Marquis de Villette at midnight, in November 1777, in the
great man's chapel of Ferney, her six uncles being present on the
occasion. Ferney had belonged to her and her six uncles, and
Voltaire was the means of reclaiming it from the possession of
certain of his neighbours into whose hands it had illegally passed in
1761. It was in the arms of "Belle et Bonne" that Voltaire passed
away on the 30th of May 1778, when he was eighty-four years old.</p>

<p>A very interesting miniature from the same collection is the
one representing a granddaughter of Nattier the artist, painted
by Louis Sicardi (<a href="#Plate_XXXIX" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XXXIX., No. 1</a>), one of the best miniaturists
of the time of Louis XVI. Sicardi painted for over fifty years,
produced a great many delightful works, and was responsible for
the decoration and portraits that, set upon gold snuff-boxes, were
such favourite presents at the French Court.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>
<p>The two greatest, however, of the painters of the French school
were Isabey and Augustin, and Isabey, who was born in 1767, forms
a curious link between the eighteenth and the twentieth centuries.
He painted Marie Antoinette, Buonaparte, the King of Rome,
and the Empress Marie Louise; he also worked for Louis XVIII.,
received high distinctions from Charles X. and from Louis Philippe,
and was appointed Commander of the Legion of Honour by
Napoleon III.: moreover, he had a long conversation with the
Empress Eugénie (who is still living) in 1854, the year in which
he died at the advanced age of eighty-eight. He exhibited between
1793 and 1841, painting portraits of all the eminent persons in
France during his long career. Of his earlier work we exhibit in
colour two charming companion miniatures from the collection
of Mr. Ward Usher, representing the <i>Empress Josephine</i>, and the
<i>Empress Marie Louise</i> (<a href="#Plate_XL" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XL.</a>), while of his later, somewhat
more florid work, almost invariably distinguished by the presence of
a light gauzy scarf which he wound about his sitter, and which he
painted to perfection, we give two portraits, one a portrait of
<i>Catherine, Countess Beauchamp</i>, from the collection of Lady Maria
Ponsonby (<a href="#Plate_XLI" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XLI.</a>), and the other depicting <i>Fürstin Katharina
Bagration Shawronska</i> (<a href="#Plate_XLII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XLII.</a>), from the collection of Fürst
Franz Auersperg.</p>

<p>One of the loveliest miniatures Isabey ever painted is that representing
<i>Queen Hortense and her son Napoleon III.</i>, in the collection
of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan. It contains autograph information in
the Emperor's handwriting attesting to its history, and is a lovely
example of Isabey's easy, graceful, pleasing work. It is illustrated
on <a href="#Plate_XLIII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XLIII.</a></p>

<p>An interesting feature of some of Isabey's miniatures is the fact
that he worked in conjunction with two Dutch artists, the brothers
Van Spaendonck. They were expert painters of flowers and fruit,
often employed at the Sévres porcelain factories, one of them being
as well a professor of natural history and lecturer on flowers in Paris,
and the author of one or two books on flowers and flower-painting.
There are several examples of the work of Isabey in which one or
other of these brothers has supplied the floral decoration, or a group
of fruit in the background.</p>

<p>We now come to Jean Baptiste Jacques Augustin, one of the
noblest of the miniature painters of France. He was born in 1759,
upon the same day, although separated from him by an interval of
ten years, as that on which the great Napoleon, whose portrait
Augustin was afterwards to paint, came into the world. He came
over to Paris as quite a boy, and lived in a house in that city to
which he returned many years afterwards, bringing with him a bride,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
and where, as a married man, he resided for a considerable time. For a
while he found life a hard struggle, but his rare merit soon brought him
many clients, and from about 1790 onward until the close of his life,
he seems to have had a succession of sitters, including all the notabilities
of the day. He left behind him a wonderful collection of sketches,
contained in various books, and a large number of unfinished miniatures.
Some few years ago the members of the family, in whose
possession this great collection had remained, desirous of portioning
off two of their daughters, offered the collection for sale. The
Directors of the Louvre very much desired to purchase it, as it
included many works of great importance, but the whole collection
passed into the hands of Mr. Pierpont Morgan, and fills one entire
cabinet, giving a view of this artist's work altogether unrivalled.
The illustrations which we give are of Augustin's later work rather
than those of the early years, although with them is included a
brilliant unfinished sketch, representing <i>The Father of Madame Seguin</i>
(<a href="#Plate_XLIV" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XLIV., No. 2</a>). The one from Mr. Ward Usher's collection
represented in colour is a portrait of <i>Madame Récamier</i> (<a href="#Plate_XLV" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XLV.</a>),
that from Mr. Morgan's collection in monotone, the famous <i>Madame
de Boufflers</i> (<a href="#Plate_XLIV" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XLIV., No. 1</a>), the friend of David Hume, who
introduced the historian to J. J. Rousseau, and is so frequently
alluded to in Horace Walpole's letters. When she fled from France,
Madame de Boufflers resided for some time in or near London, and
Walpole spoke of her as the most agreeable and sensible woman he
ever saw, but he was greatly amused at her want of appreciation of
his house. She had never seen a printing press until she came to
Strawberry Hill, and Walpole arranged that on the occasion of her
visit his private press should print a few lines of French poetry in her
praise. In one of his gossipy letters we are told that Madame de
Boufflers informed Lord Onslow of the birth of Lord Salisbury two
hours after his mother had come from the Opera House, and that from
Lord Onslow Walpole himself heard the news.</p>

<p>Of E. W. Thompson, an Englishman, who spent very much of
his time in France, and is regarded by the French critics almost as
one of themselves, we know very little, but the <i>Princess de Lieven</i>,
whose portrait he painted (<a href="#Plate_XLIII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XLIII.</a>), was one of the great
ladies of Europe in the nineteenth century. She was a personal
friend of Count Metternich and afterwards of Guizot, and Madame
de Lieven kept up a steady correspondence with both these statesmen,
and exercised, without doubt, a very considerable influence upon
European politics.</p>

<p>Two artists of Italian parentage deserve mention, especially as
we are able to illustrate, by the permission of their owner, Mr. Ward
Usher, delightfully signed examples of their work. By Costa we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
show an interesting portrait of <i>Marie Antoinette</i> (<a href="#Plate_XLVI" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XLVI.</a>)
which came from the Bentinck-Hawkins collection; and by
Anguissola, the favourite miniature painter to the court of the
great Napoleon, we illustrate, in reduced size, a fine portrait of the
Emperor's sister, <i>Princess Pauline Borghese</i> (<a href="#Plate_XLVII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XLVII.</a>).</p>

<p>Special attention has been given in our illustrations to the work
of the great Viennese miniature painter Füger, because very little is
known of his work in England, and there are so few examples of it
to be found in English collections. The Viennese collectors seem
determined that all the finest works by Füger shall remain in their
own city, and they are prepared to give high prices in order that they
may carry out this desire. One of the chief collectors in Vienna
is Dr. Figdor, and he has been exceedingly kind in allowing many
miniatures from his collection to be illustrated for the purpose of
this essay, amongst them, five by Füger, perhaps a rather large
proportion; but it has been felt that, as the work of the painter is
so little known in England, it was well in our illustrations to err
on the right side, and give several examples of his delightful
workmanship. For a long time the details of his life were buried
in obscurity, and all sorts of mistakes were made respecting his
work, which was confused with that of other painters, and in some
instances not recognised at all. It was not until 1905, when
Herr Doktor Ferdinand Laban published a very important article
upon him, that Füger's true position was apparent, and Dr. Laban
was able from family records to set right the errors of those writers,
amongst whom we must include ourselves, who had gone astray
from lack of the very material Dr. Laban was able to discover.
Since then, Herr Eduard Leisching has added considerably to our
information in a splendid book he published on Austrian miniature
painters, and he has discovered many more examples of Füger's
work, who can now be justly recognised as the greatest of the
Continental eighteenth-century miniaturists. He has been called
the Viennese Cosway, but the work of Füger has very little affinity
with that of our English painter. It is far stronger and more
severe, and his more graceful portraits are richer in their colour
scheme, and far more elaborate in their decorative effect than
anything ever painted by Cosway. There are two wonderful
miniatures by Füger in Mr. Pierpont Morgan's collection, one
representing three sisters, the Countesses Thun-Hohenstein, and
the other Madame Rousbaeck, a lady-in-waiting to the Empress
Marie Theresa, but Dr. Figdor's illustrations set forth in excellent
manner both the strength and the charm of this wonderful painter.
Nothing can be more forcible than the sketch of <i>Prince Hohenlohe</i>
(<a href="#Plate_XLVIII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XLVIII.</a>), and we realise the power and dignity of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
sitter when we regard this marvellous delineation of character.
For dainty grace it is difficult to excel the portrait of the
anonymous lady (<a href="#Plate_XLIX" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate XLIX.</a>), for strength and gracious dignity
that of the <i>Empress Maria</i> (<a href="#Plate_L" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate L.</a>), while the portrait of <i>Marie
Theresia, Countess von Dietrichstein</i> (<a href="#Plate_LI" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate LI.</a>) is that of a noble
dignified lady of high position, splendid courage, and great charm,
and that of <i>Princess Anna Liechtenstein</i> (<a href="#Plate_LII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate LII.</a>) shows us a
thoughtful, learned, and musical lady, a portrait very decorative
in colour scheme, and charmingly set upon its oval of ivory.</p>

<p>Another painter whose work was exceedingly popular in
Vienna, was Giovanni Battista de Lampi, an Italian born near
Trent in 1751, a man very little known outside the narrow limits
of the Viennese collectors. He was a wanderer for a few years,
painting in Verona, and moving on until he reached St. Petersburg,
but when in 1783 he came to Vienna, he was received with open
arms, was welcomed by the court and the nobility to such an
extent that practically for the rest of his life he resided either in
Vienna, or in various towns of Poland from which he could easily
reach the capital itself. It was in Vienna that he died at the age
of eighty, universally respected and greatly beloved. His wife's
portrait is in the gallery at Innsbrück, one of three replicas. The
original Lampi retained for himself. His two sons each had
replicas, and the remaining one went to his granddaughter, the
Baroness Hell, who left it to the museum. One of the replicas
which came into the possession of his sons is now a great treasure
in Mr. Pierpont Morgan's collection. The portrait from that
of Dr. Figdor, which we illustrate in colour, represents Lampi
himself (<a href="#Plate_LIII" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate LIII.</a>), and is not only a fine example of the
artist's work, serious, and almost solemn in its aspect, but also
peculiarly interesting as showing us what the painter himself
was like.</p>

<p>Another Viennese miniature painter whose work we illustrate
is Moritz Michael Daffinger, who has been called the Austrian
Isabey, but these comparisons, like that applied to Füger, are of
little significance. What is of special interest with regard to
Daffinger is the fact that he adopted the manner of Sir Thomas
Lawrence as his own. Lawrence visited Vienna in 1814, and was
received with great honour. While there he painted some
portraits. Daffinger admired his work immensely, and undoubtedly
some of his best miniatures are reminiscent of Lawrence.
Especially is this the case with a beautiful girl's portrait from the
collection of another Viennese collector, Gräfin Emma Wilczek-Emo-Capodilista;
and for permission to illustrate this delightful
miniature (<a href="#Plate_LIV" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate LIV.</a>) we are particularly grateful, as it is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
charming specimen of the best work of the nineteenth century, a
pleasing portrait, and very agreeable in its colour scheme.</p>

<p>Daffinger had many pupils, and one of them, Emanuel Peter,
exceeded all the rest in skill. We illustrate two clever portraits by
him (<a href="#Plate_LV" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate LV.</a>), from Dr. Figdor's collection, in which the ladies
are wearing very decorative head-dresses. It is suggested that the
two fair sitters were relatives, probably cousins, and were painted
for some exceptional occasion, perhaps a masquerade, as the custom
to wear fantastic head-dresses for such special entertainments still
prevails in Vienna.</p>

<p>Finally we must mention Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller, whose
own portrait by himself appears on <a href="#Plate_LVI" style=
"text-decoration: none;">Plate LVI</a>. He was one of
Lampi's pupils, but, like Daffinger, a profound admirer of Sir
Thomas Lawrence. His early days were one continual struggle,
and he earned his living by painting bon-bon boxes, and by
giving lessons in drawing in girls' schools, until his skill was recognised
and he had won a position for himself in Vienna. He even
went on the stage in a travelling troupe with his beautiful wife,
who was an actress, but forced the attention of critics by his
splendid portrait studies, and at length was appointed curator of
the Lamberg Gallery, became a popular portrait painter, and died
in 1865 justly esteemed for his skill and ability.</p>

<p>Our survey of this fascinating art of the miniature painter has
necessarily been brief. There is still a good deal of information to
be gathered up concerning the eighteenth-century artists, and
probably some of their descendants possess papers and records of vast
interest, hidden away amongst family treasures. Perchance this
essay may encourage some of them to make the necessary search,
and so add to the information available on the lives and careers,
especially of our English miniature painters.</p>

<p>Of the earlier men there is not much chance of obtaining new
information now, but there is always a possibility that letters or
sketches by such a painter as Cooper may again come to light, and
if such so fortunate a circumstance were to take place we should
delight to learn more of the greatest of our British miniature
painters, whose portraits were for so many years ignored in favour
of the more brilliant, but far less important, works of the painters
who exhibited in the early days of the Royal Academy.</p>
